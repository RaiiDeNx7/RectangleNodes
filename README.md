# Project Details
For this project, you’ll create a quadtree data structure and manipulate it with data. To ensure you learn
proper object-oriented programming techniques, there will be a few requirements for your
implementation of this project. Namely:
• You must have a base Node class.
• You must have an InternalNode class that inherits from the base Node class.
• You must have a LeafNode class that inherits from the base Node class.

Implement five operations on your data structure:
• Insert Rectangle – insert a rectangle into the quadtree.
• Delete Rectangle – delete a rectangle from the quadtree.
• Find Rectangle – find a rectangle in the quadtree.
• Dump tree – print the quadtree.
• Update Rectangle – change the length and width of a rectangle.
