# Project Details
Calculator Overview:
For this project, you must create a calculator that works in Roman numerals. Your application should take
an equation as command line parameters and print the resulting number in roman numerals. 



# Expected Errors Detection
Roman numerals do not have concepts of floating-point numbers, negative numbers, or zero. As a result,
the user, me, will not try to input any of these. Similarly, you should not report any of these either:

- [x] 1. Rectangle Class
